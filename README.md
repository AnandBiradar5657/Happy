# vmstate-operator
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

**Pre-requisite** Need to login to any image registry and replace registry in the command below & create a secret in the operator namespace with AWS environment variables
```
kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --from-literal=region=us-east-1 --from-literal=aws-secret-access-key=<secret access key> --from-literal=aws-access-key-id=<secret access key id>
```
### Running on the cluster
1. Build and push your image:
	
```sh
make generate;make manifests;
make docker-build;
sudo docker push quay.io/talat_shaheen0/vmstate-operator:latest;
```
OR

```
make generate;make manifests;
make docker-build docker-push IMG="quay.io/talat_shaheen0/vmstate-operator:latest"
make deploy IMG="quay.io/talat_shaheen0/vmstate-operator:latest"
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make deploy quay.io/talat_shaheen0/vmstate-operator:tag
```

3. Apply Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/awsmanager_v1_awsmanager.yaml -n vmstate-operator-system;
kubectl apply -f config/samples/aws_v1_awsec2.yaml -n vmstate-operator-system;
```
3. Check jobs & AWSEC2:

```
kubectl get jobs -n vmstate-operator-system;
kubectl get awsec2 -n vmstate-operator-system;
```

4. Delete CR:

```
kubectl delete awsec2 <xyz> -n vmstate-operator-system;
```
### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
